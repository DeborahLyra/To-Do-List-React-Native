#Project using React Native

It is my first project using this framework.

 It is a To Do List where it should contain the following topics:

1. Create a To Do List
2. Implement add task button
3. Implement the task item, which shows the task text and delete button.
4. Implementing the task delete button needs to be an image within a TouchableOpacity;
5. Implement the title ("To-Do List");
6. Implement the add task field with placeholder ("What needs to be done?");
7. Implement the logic for adding tasks;
8. Implement the logic for removing tasks;
9. Implement a list of tasks with numbering;
10. Style the application;
